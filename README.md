# CS220AU Digital Portfolio Template (2022)
## Overview
This GitHub repository is the template for the [CS220AU](https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220AU) assignment in 2022. It demonstrates minimalistic ideas for 

- project management
- web hosting with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
- web-design with [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and
- evaluation with the `assessment.md` and the `dp-checklist.md` files. 

The URL of the website can be found in the sidebar, under 'About'. The homepage uses the information in the `index.md` file.

## Portfolio items
The portfolio you submit needs to contain the following:

1. **website** (80% of your overall mark) exploring the theme given.
2. **self-and peer-assessment** (10% of your overall mark) using the marking rubric in the `assessment.md` file.
3. **portfolio overview** (10% of your overall mark) providing a succinct overview of your portfolio, an outline of completed tasks (Log) and tasks to do (TODO) in this `README.md` file.

After you finish these items, complete the `dp-checklist.md` file, download it and submit it on FASER. (Please keep this file in your repository as well after submitting.) In essence, you need to submit only one file on FASER, this `dp-checklist.md`. 

How to use this GitHub repository as a template for your submission, including how to submit your files on FASER is demonstrated in class. If anything is unclear, ask for clarification.
