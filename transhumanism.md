As I mentioned in the introduction, nowadays technology is more and more present in the lives of human beings and that with it, a much stronger connection between technology and people has been created. Because of this a very interesting and disturbing new theory has arisen which I am going to talk about below. 

### TRANSHUMANISM
**_What is it?_**

---
> Transhumanism is: "a cultural, intellectual and scientific movement that affirms the moral duty to enhance the physical and cognitive capacities of the human species and to apply new technologies to man, so that unwanted and unnecessary aspects of the human condition, such as suffering, disease, aging, and even mortality, can be eliminated.
- Nick Bostrom, World Transhumanist Association.

As its definition and objectives indicate, through Artificial Intelligence, transhumanism aims to have total control over the body and to modify whatever people want through the incorporation of technology into the body. Sight, memory capacity, or physical resistance, among many others, are aspects that could be changed so that human beings will cease to be human and will become a new species called posthumans or transhumans. 

Although this concept may seem crazy initially, it is already underway and can be found in many things today. One example is the concept of cyborgs, which are people who, thanks to having cybernetic devices incorporated into their bodies, can develop capacities and abilities that they would not be able to have without these devices. One of them is Neil Harbisson who, after suffering all his life from achromatopsia, decided to implant a chip in his skull that transforms sounds into colours, which has allowed him to become a very avant-garde artist and to see invisible colours such as ultraviolet.

Another example is the neurotech company created by Elon Mask, called Neuralink, which uses Artificial Intelligence as the basis for all its approaches. The company wants to merge the human body with technology, specifically the brain. This consists of a brain implant that would help prevent diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. It would also allow access and storage of the thoughts of those who have this implant, but if these thoughts are inside a computer, questions arise such as: can anyone other than us access these thoughts, is this secure, would they be exposed to hackers?

On the one hand, if the mission of these fusions with technology and the human body is to improve people's lives and make the diseases that affect them disappear, this would be a real breakthrough and would be very beneficial in today's world. But, on the other hand, as the founder of the transhumanism movement himself said, it would also be to avoid suffering, eliminate what makes us vulnerable and give us new capabilities. That is, it would be to add new characteristics that are not human, and remove others that are, but aren't those characteristics, such as suffering or vulnerability, what makes us truly human? If suffering disappears and the person is modified, would human beings value the good times or would this create a much more superficial world based on boasting about what one has by creating a superior being? 

**_What does it mean to be better or superior for transhumanism?_**

This movement aims to improve the qualities of human beings and create something superior and with more freedom, or as they call the posthuman or transhuman. However, not everyone has the same concept of perfection or improvement. Every part of the human body that is replaced by technological devices will lead to the disappearance of its identity and its human essence, and the person would also be at the disposal of this technology and whoever can control it.

Likewise, this theory, by proposing the influence of technology on human thoughts, would also have consequences on their way of thinking, their tastes, the religion they practice, and their relationships with others, among others. By undergoing all these changes, both human and digital identities would be modified, since if the person gradually changes everything they think and who they are, they will no longer share the same things on the internet, or will not have the same interests on the internet, among other things, so the image they project on the internet will also be completely modified. Their relationship with the network would be much closer, as they would have the technology itself within themselves. 

The most radical side of this theory is its proposal for the complete loss of the identity of the human being as such and to have only a digital identity. This would be done by uploading the identity of the person into the computer cloud and thus being able to live forever in virtual worlds and the elimination of the human body. Precisely this topic is dealt with in the famous HBO series "Years and years", where in one scene a girl asks her parents to enter a Swiss clinic where she would be converted into data and would always be in the cloud.
